#parrot = "Norwegian Blue"
#Add some characters to the program, so that it prints out 'we win'
#Each character should appear on a separate line
#The program should get the characters from the parrot string, using indexing
#With the text that is already printed, the final output from the program should be:
        #Norwegian Blue
        #w
        #e

        #w
        #i
        #n

#Solve:- By using only postive numbers as Indexing number:
parrot = "Norwegian Blue"
print(parrot)
print(parrot[3])
print(parrot[4])
print(parrot[9])
print(parrot[3])
print(parrot[6])
print(parrot[8])
