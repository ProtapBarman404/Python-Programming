# Python Programming
 Learning Day by Day
In this repository I'll update my day by day learning process.
This process is based on a Udemy course - https://www.udemy.com/course/python-the-complete-python-developer-course/
I have not taken this course officially, I have downloaded this course through third party sites and I try to update this course every month if available. I'm litterlly on a point where I can only efford money for Internet.
